\MPS{We present a novel combination of process synchronisation and mobility with
the concept of discrete time in the form of the TNT process calculus. This forms
the basis of a framework for complex systems, consisting of hierarchical
components, the composition of which changes over time and which contain
processes that may interact, both in response to others and to external stimuli,
and move between different environments during execution.}{We present
\emph{TNT}, a novel calculus combining explicit clocks and run-to-completion
semantics with mobility, and demonstrate its suitability for modelling complex
hierarachical systems with dynamic topology.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\MPS{When modelling complex systems, we ideally want to be able to break the
problem down into easily digestible components.  We can then work on
each individually, perfecting them up to the point where there are
amalgamated in order to form a complete system.  This approach is common
in sequential models (object-oriented ones in particular) and extends
cleanly into the concurrent domain.  In this arena, components not only
have their own defined behaviour, but also operate simultaneously, thus
placing more emphasis on the interaction between them.

This idea also encompasses a simple model of reality, where a
component represents a microcosm of the real world.  Such environments
contain multiple processes or objects which communicate with each
other.  These are analogous to individuals conversing with one another
in reality, in order to achieve their task.  Both can also act in
isolation; such sequential behaviour is a subset of the overall
concurrent behaviour modelled within this environment.

Formal methods for reasoning about such systems are already well developed. In
the area of process algebra, in particular, concurrent interaction is generally
represented by \emph{synchronization} between processes.}{A standard feature of
concurrent systems modelling is the use of \emph{synchronisation} to model
\emph{interaction}.} Indeed, this is the defining concept of CCS
\cite{milner:ccs}. \MPS{Calculi}{In contrast, calculi} that include
\emph{localities} \MPS{\ADDTEXT}{-- for example the \emph{ambient calculus}
\cite{amb} --} also allow the notion of componentisation to be explicitly
realised by \MPS{dividing}{forming} processes into a hierarchy. \MPS{One
proponent of this technique is the ambient calculus \cite{amb}, which focuses on
these entities (known as `ambients' in this context) and allows their position
to change during execution.}{The inclusion of locality naturally leads to
\emph{mobility}, the ability of a system to change its topological structure
unilaterally. Consequently, the ambient calculus and its analogues are well
positioned to model distributed systems in which resources can migrate from one
location to another.}

What tends to be absent from these models\MPS{\ADDTEXT}{, however,} is the
notion of behaviour also being governed by time, or at least, some notion of
\MPS{phasing}{workflow}. Some calculi maintain real time values
\cite{tccs,beaten:timing,brics:lee}, but \MPS{a}{the} notion \MPS{of discrete
time maintains a more abstract perspective}{that work typically occurs in stages
in modelled only abstractly}. \MPS{This is most easily understood by
\AJH{\DELTEXT again}{} relating \AJH{the}{this} idea to our own experiences.
Although we have exact times, such as fourteen minutes past two o'clock, we
rarely care about the actual time. What is more important is that a particular
event occurs at some point in time, or that a task needs to be completed by an
arbitrary deadline. Thus, time can be more simply represented as a signal that
our processes respond to as a whole, as opposed to the one-to-one communication
activities previously mentioned.

As an example}{For example}, consider an environment inhabited by the members of
a factory team. The team receives a \MPS{particular task}{series of tasks} to
execute, which \MPS{involves communication between each of their
colleagues.}{require the team members to communicate with one another.} At some
point\MPS{in time, this}{, the first task} is completed\MPS{; there is no more
work to be done, so each individual moves on to the new task simultaneously (as
a team).}{and the team moves on to the next. Modelling this in a setting where
the number of workers cannot be predicted typically requires the use, either of
\emph{global} synchronisation, or else (which we reject) of an infinite set of
defining equations.}

The\MPS{se concepts are realised in the existing field of}{idea of global
synchronisation via \emph{clock signals} is made explicit by various} discrete
timed process algebras, \MPS{such as}{including} TPL \cite{hennessy:tpl}, PMC
\cite{pmc}, CSA \cite{csa} and CaSE \cite{case,norton05alg}. Our contribution
\MPS{\DELTEXT in this paper}{} is to combine the notions of \MPS{locations,
discrete time and mobility}{\emph{location}, \emph{clocks} and \emph{mobility}}
to create a calculus capable of modelling dynamic componentised systems, where
behaviour is defined both by interactions between individual processes and by
responses to external stimuli, \MPS{\ADDTEXT}{as} represented by clock signals.
A number of calculi \cite{lee:realtime,satoh:phd,webpi} have already attempted
to combine mobility with real time values\QUESTION{You mentioned that such systems existed earlier, using refs 3--5. These are different refs, but it seems odd to repeat the same fact as if it were different. Or is it \emph{actually} different to what you mentioned before?}, but we believe the aggregation of
mobility and \MPS{discrete time}{discrete clocks} to be \MPS{a novel
creation}{novel}.\MPS{\DELTEXT 

To exemplify this, we can extend our factory idea to the point where that
environment is just one of many, with the additional possibility of nesting of
such entities. Thus, the factory exists and operates within the larger
environment of a city, with other buildings and individuals that have their own
separate behaviour. The factory can be thought of a single component, which
behaves in its own way, but also interacts with the surrounding environment.

To further complicate things, the hierarchy is dynamic. Individuals may move
from one environment to another, where different rules apply. Further,
environments themselves can change their location, taking on a different context
which again affects the behaviour of their constituents.}{}

Our calculus\MPS{ of Typed Nomadic Time}{, \emph{Typed Nomadic Time}} (TNT)
provides a framework for modelling such\MPS{\DELTEXT complex}{} systems, with
practical applicability very much in mind. The \MPS{objective}{object} of this
paper is to demonstrate its underlying formal theory, derived in part from
existing research in the area, via a description of its syntax, operational
semantics and type system. Our long term aim is to leverage TNT as a foundation
for creating concurrent systems within a programmatic context. This \MPS{then
allows for a}{will allow the} specification of system interactions to be shifted
directly from the theoretical domain into an implementation backed by a formal
methodology, \MPS{and, in turn, facilitates the general industry shift
towards}{helping in turn to improve industrial adoption of} concurrent
\MPS{execution}{techniques}.

\section{Typed Nomadic Time}
\label{tnt}

In this section, we present the syntax, operational semantics and type system of
TNT. In creating this calculus, \MPS{we seek not to merely instil the existing
pool of such formalisms with another, but instead focus on creating}{our aim is
not to create ``yet another process calculus,'' but rather} a framework which
allows \MPS{the systems outlined in section \ref{introduction}}{industrially
relevant systems} to be modelled in the \MPS{most simple and elegant manner.
With this in mind, we draw inspiration from several well-established areas of
concurrency theory, rather than attempting to start afresh, choosing those
concepts which best meet our ideals.}{simplest and most elegant way possible. We
have re-used well-established concepts where appropriate.}

\subsection{Syntax}

The formal syntax of TNT is shown \MPS{below}{in (\ref{eqn:tnt-syntax})}, where
$\expr$ and $\exprb$ define possible process terms and $\ambop$
\MPS{possible}{the available} mobility primitives. We \MPS{define}{assume} a
countable set of actions, $\actions = \names \cup \conames \cup \{\tau\}$,
\MPS{over which $\alpha$ and $\beta$ range}{ranged over by $\alpha$ and
$\beta$}, where the elements of $\names$ are drawn from an infinite set of
\MPS{names}{\emph{names}}, and $\conames$ is the corresponding set of
\MPS{co-names}{\emph{co-names}}, $\{\overline{a} \mid a \in \names\}$. $\timers$
is a countably infinite set of \MPS{clocks}{\emph{clocks}} over which $\sigma$
ranges, while $m$ represents an arbitrary \MPS{environ name. The latter are not
distinct, and hence do not form a set.}{\emph{environ name}.} In particular, $m$
may be equal to the empty string, $\epsilon$, thus facilitating the use of
anonymous environs\footnote{A primary motivation for this is that it allows TNT
to be a conservative extension of CaSE. To obtain an encoding for clock hiding,
there must be a way of mapping the operator to an equivalent environ}. $X$
\MPS{is a variable from a countably infinite set}{ranges over a countably
infinite set of variables, which are} used to bind process behaviour \MPS{for
the purpose of recursion}{in recursive process definitions}.

At its heart, TNT is a conservative extension of Milner's CCS.
Specifically, within each environment lie processes which interact with
one another via \emph{handshake} synchronization; to proceed, one
process must emit an action as another simultaneously emits the
corresponding co-action.  This is something TNT shares with its
predecessor, CaSE, from which it also acquires the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple \emph{abstract clocks}, denoted by $\sigma, \rho, \dots$,
      which are interpreted not as quantitative values, but in a
      qualitative fashion as signals of recurring events.
\item Two \emph{timeout} operators, $\timeout{E}{\sigma}{F}$ and
      $\stimeout{E}{\sigma}{F}$, which allow the behaviour of
      processes to depend upon the occurrence of a particular clock
      signal.
\item Two \emph{timelock} operators, $\Delta$ and $\Delta_{\sigma}$,
      which prevent all clocks \MPS{and a single clock, $\sigma$}{(or a single
      clock, $\sigma$)} from ticking, respectively.
\item The concept of \emph{maximal progress} or, more generally,
      prioritisation.  A signal from a clock may be pre-empted by the
      existence of a process \MPS{which may engage in a high}{that engages in a higher} priority
      transition.  In CaSE, the only such transition is the internal action,
      $\tau$, which results in processes performing the maximal amount
      of possible behaviour before \MPS{a clock tick}{allowing a clock to tick}.
\item Encapsulation, realised in CaSE by the process of \emph{clock
      hiding}, which is analogous to the notion of hiding found in
      CSP \cite{hoare:csp78}.  This facilities the amalgamation of clock ticks
      from a child component into the cycle of its parent.
\end{enumerate}

Clocks and the operators outlined above exist largely unchanged (for the
time being) within TNT, their presence merely allowing process behaviour
to incorporate the notion of discrete time.  It is the two general
concepts of encapsulation and prioritisation that actually makes this
valuable, by permitting componentisation and synchronous event cycles,
and thus, it is these which TNT extends.

Within CaSE, encapsulation is implicitly realised by the notion of clock
hiding.  When a clock, $\sigma$, is hidden it appears indistinguishable
from an internal action to observers outside the scope of the hiding
operator.  The effect of this, when combined with maximal progress, is
to have an entire subsystem (defined by the clock's scope) appear
equivalent to a single process, with respect to the cycles of clocks
with a wider scope.  This means that, just as with processes, the
subsystem must perform the maximal amount of behaviour before the next
of the more general clock ticks occurs.

In TNT, we make this notion explicit by representing the boundaries of
the component within the syntax itself.  The effect of these is also
extended to processes, with interaction being disallowed between those
in separate environments.  In doing so, we look towards the existing
area of \emph{localities} \cite{obslocal,pawl} which have been used in
various ways in a number of existing calculi.  After surveying this area
at some length, we draw most of our inspiration from Cardelli and
Gordon's ambient calculus, which focuses primarily on this concept and
forms the framework for many of the results in this field.

Our localities or \emph{environs} are realised in the process
$\locv{m}{\expr}{\exprb}{\vec{\sigma}}$.  The environ is given a name
($m$), some behaviour ($\expr$), a security model in the form of a
`bouncer' ($\exprb$) and a set of clocks, $\vec{\sigma}$.  The latter
forms our equivalent of the CaSE clock hiding operator ($\{ \sigma \}$ is
equivalent to $/ \sigma$) but with application to all clocks in the set
simultaneously.

The name of the environ is used with TNT's mobility primitives, which
are an extension of those present in the ambient calculus.  We maintain
the $in\ m$, $out\ m$ and $open\ m$ primitives, representing them
instead as the mnemonics $\tntin{m}$, $\tntout{m}$ and $\tntopen{m}$ to
prevent confusion with the names of actions.  To this, we add two
primitives for process mobility, $\procin{\beta}{m}$ and
$\procout{\beta}{m}$, which allow objective mobility to occur via
synchronization on the action, $\beta$.

When movement occurs, a mobility transition is emitted which forms part of a high
priority set.  This, in turn, provides TNT's extension of the concept of
maximal progress to a more general one of prioritisation.  The system at
this stage is still simple; it merely formalises the concept of
including mobility within the same class of functionality as internal
behaviour and synchronisation, both of which result in silent actions.

Transitions are divided into three sets:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\highpri$, the \emph{high priority transitions}, which includes $\tau$ and
      the mobility transitions, $\tin$, $\tout$ and $\topen$.
\item $\lowpri$, the \emph{low priority transitions}, which includes all
      clock ticks (and is thus equal to $\timers$).
\item $\independent$, the \emph{independent transitions}, which arise from the
      occurrence of actions that don't pair up with the corresponding
      co-action (or vice versa).  These neither pre-empt or inhibit any
      other transitions.  This set is equal to $\names \cup \conames$.
\end{enumerate}

If a process may emit a transition in $\highpri$, then those transitions
in $\lowpri$ are prevented from occurring.  The same division may be
applied to CaSE, where $\highpri$ is simply $\{ \tau \}$.

Finally, TNT provides a method of security based on the research into
safe ambients \cite{sangiorgi:mobsafeambients}.  \emph{Grave
interferences} occur when two logically different mobility transitions may
occur at the same time, a scenario which clearly leads to two radically
different reductions.  These are unlike normal interferences, where more
than one action competes for synchronisation, and tend to represent
errors rather than an intentional notion of competition for resources.
They occur because, unlike actions, the mobility primitives in the
ambient calculus occur in isolation rather than in pairs.  Both safe
ambients and TNT solve this problem by introducing the equivalent of
co-names for mobility primitives, so that a similar synchronisation
process must take place before movement occurs.

In TNT, this is realised by \emph{bouncers}.  Named after the person who
restricts access to a night club, the bouncer is an additional property
of a environ which appears in the top right.  It has no real behaviour
of its own, but instead performs the job of protecting the environ,
essentially being a process with a more limited choice of available
constructs\footnote{This limited choice is only explicitly imposed by
the type system.  There is no restriction in the abstract syntax.}.  The
bouncer provides the co-primitives (either $\bin$, $\bout$ or $\bopen$),
and as a result dictates which mobility transitions may occur and their
cardinality.

This implementation differs from that in existing calculi, such as
Sangiorgi's safe ambients, in specialising the process which may provide
these co-primitives and also in attaching it to the environ itself.
When a TNT environ moves, its bouncer moves with it and so an
association is maintained between the two which is not present where the
co-primitives are provided by an normal arbitrary process.  To maintain
this distinction between bouncers and normal processes, $\Omega$ is used
to represent a bouncer with no behaviour, as opposed to $\nil$.  The
effect of this addition is shown later in the type system of section
\ref{typesys}.

\subsection{Operational Semantics}

This section gives TNT an operational semantics in terms of a labelled
transition system, $(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{L}, \rightarrow, s)$, defined
up to structural congruence.  $\proc$ is the set of states, \labels the
alphabet $\actions \cup \timers \cup \mobprim$, $\rightarrow$ the
transition relation and $s$ the start state.  Transitions with labels in
$\actions$ are known as \emph{action transitions}, those in $\timers$ as
\emph{clock transitions} and those in $\mobprim$ as \emph{mobility
transitions}.  The transition relation, $\rightarrow \subseteq
\proc \times \labels \times \proc$ is defined in the tables that follow.
$E$, $F$ and $G$ range over process terms, $\sigma$ and $\rho$ over the
set of clocks ($\timers$), $\alpha$ over the set of actions
($\actions$), $h$ over $\highpri$, $a$ and $b$ over the actions
sans $\tau$, $\kappa$ over $\actions \cup \mobprim$
and $\gamma$ over the whole alphabet.  The semantics exhibit the
following properties:
\begin{prop}
the prioritisation property
i.e. $E \derives{\sigma}$ implies $E \nderives{h}$ 
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}
the time determinacy property i.e. $E \derives{\sigma} E'$ and $E
\derives{\sigma} E''$ implies $E' = E''$.
\end{prop}
Structural congruence is the least congruence relation that satisfies
the laws given in Table \ref{tab:structcong}, allowing structural
rearrangement and simplification of process terms. $\vec{A}$, $\vec{B}$
and $\vec{C}$ range over subsets of \actions, while $fn(E)$ refers to
the \emph{free names} of the process, $E$.  This set is constructed from
all names that occur within $E$, with the exception of those bound by
the restriction operator.

\textsf{(\ref{structsum1})} and \textsf{(\ref{structsum2})} make the
summation operator commutative and associative respectively, while
\textsf{(\ref{structpar1})} and \textsf{(\ref{structpar2})} do the same
for parallel composition.  The operator $\pc$ forms a monoid under
\textsf{(\ref{structpar2})} and \textsf{(\ref{structident})}, the latter
identity law allowing superfluous $\nil$ processes to be removed.  The
final three focus on restriction, which may be:

\begin{itemize}
\item Removed from $\nil$ processes \textsf{(\ref{structresremove})}
\item The set of restricted actions may be split between two parallel
      composed processes so that the restricted actions are not in the
      free names of the other process \textsf{(\ref{structrespar})}.
\item Multiple restriction operators may be combined into a single set
      \textsf{(\ref{structresres}))}.
\end{itemize}

both TNT and CaSE. $Idle$ and $Patient$ represent the progress of time
over $\nil$ and action prefixes respectively.  $Act$ allows an action to
be performed, with an appropriately labelled action transition and the
process continuing as $E$.  $Stall$ represents the stopping of a
specific clock, $\sigma$, allowing transitions to occur for any other
clock, $\rho$.

$Sum1$ and $Par1$ represent the performance of an action on either side
of the summation and parallel composition operators.  These differ
slightly from those in CaSE, as commutativity is now implied by the
aforementioned structural congruence rules.  $Sum2$ and $Par3$ represent
the passage of time over these two operators.  Note that time must be
able to pass on both sides, and that prioritisation is enforced by the
restriction $E \;|\; F \nderives{h}$ in $Par3$.

$Par2$ encapsulates synchronization; when one of the processes can
perform an action and the other can perform the matching co-action, a
silent action is performed and both evolve.  $FTO1$ and $STO1$ are
identical, allowing the dissolution of the timeout via a tick of the
associated clock, $\sigma$, on the provision that $E \nderives{h}$.  The
difference between the two timeouts is demonstrated by $FTO2$, $STO2$
and $STO3$.  $FTO2$ is a general rule for the fragile timeout, which
allows $E$ to execute and the timeout to be removed on the occurrence of
any transition other than the expected clock tick.  For the stable
timeout, all clock transitions are handled separately from other
transitions.  According to $STO3$, clocks other than $\sigma$ may tick,
but the timeout stays in place.  $STO2$ handles the removal of the
stable timeout, due to an action or mobility transition performed by
$E$.

Finally, $Rec$ provides recursion, performing substitution of $X$ for
the body of the recursion as soon as any transition, $\gamma$, occurs
and $Res$ defines restriction, which disallows any transitions for the
given action.

The semantics given in Table \ref{tab:hidingsubset} are similar to the
hiding rules given for CaSE, but are instead applied to the new
syntactic form used in TNT.  Also included are rules which allow the
mobility prefix to evolve, thus completing the semantics for the syntax
of $\expr$ and $\exprb$, and which link the structural congruence rules
into the labelled transition system.

$LHd1$ provides the conversion of ticks emitted by the hidden clocks to
silent actions; if $E$ can perform a $\sigma$ transition, then it
performs a $\tau$ transition in a context where $\sigma$ is one of the
hidden clocks.  $LHd2$ and $LHd3$ simply allow the remaining action,
mobility and clock transitions to occur normally.  $Cap1$ and $Cap2$
define the evolution of the mobility prefix, allowing the mobility
primitive to execute and for clocks to idle over it, respectively.
Finally, $SCong$ states that if $E$ is structurally equivalent to
$E^\prime$ and $E^\prime$ can evolve to become $F^\prime$, which is
itself structurally equivalent to $F$, then $E$ can evolve via the same
transition to become $F$.

The remaining semantics focus on the provision of mobility.  Table
\ref{tab:locmobsubset} gives the rules required to move an environ
around the hierarchy.  $InLoc$ allows a $\tin$ transition to occur and
$n$ to move into $m$ if both an $\tntin{m}$ and an $\bin$ transition are
available from the process $\tntin{m}.E$ and the bouncer, $B_1$,
respectively.  $OutLoc$ gives the converse for $\tntout{m}.E$
and $\bout$, causing an $\tout$ transition to occur and $n$ to move
outside $n$.

Table \ref{tab:open} depicts the behaviour of $\tntopen{m}$, which
causes a $\topen$ transition to occur when both an $\tntopen{m}$ and an
$\bopen$ transition are available.  The named environ, $m$, is destroyed
and the two clock contexts unified.

Finally, Table \ref{tab:procmobsubset} shows the semantics which relate
to how processes move between environs.  In both rules, $E$ moves due to
a mobility primitive which is part of $F$.  This occurs if
$\procin{a}{m}$ or $\procout{a}{m}$, $a$ and $\bin$ or $\bout$ transitions
take place, respectively.  An appropriate mobility transition ($\tin$
or $\tout$) is emitted as a result of this three-way synchronization.

\end{table}

Process mobility, in this form, is \emph{objective}.  The process which
emits one of the two new process mobility primitives synchronises with a
partner process on the given action, and it is this partner which
actually moves.  The partner will be a process in the same environ, due
to the scoping of actions described above.

Such behaviour is initially difficult to understand, but can be made
clearer with a simple example.  Take the process,

\begin{equation}
\procin{go}{m}.E \pc go.F \pc \lcloc{m}{\nil}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $E$ may perform $\procin{go}{m}$, but it
is $go.F$ that will actually move,

\begin{equation}
\procin{go}{m}.E \pc go.F \pc \lcloc{m}{\nil}{\sigma} \derives{\tin}
E \pc \lcloc{m}{F \pc \nil}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent with the continuation, $F$, continuing to evolve in the
environ $m$.  Process mobility in this objective form may still be used
to perform subjective movement.  As processes can fork, a process that
wishes to move can evolve into a situation where it is composed in
parallel with a new process that exhibits the required movement
primitive.  To demonstrate the converse, $out$, in the scenario
above, $F$ can be defined as

\begin{equation}
F \eqdef leave.F^\prime \pc \procout{leave}{m}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the process on the right moves the one on the left
outside $m$.  In context, this performs as follows:

\begin{equation}
E \pc \lcloc{m}{leave.F^\prime \pc \procout{leave}{m}.\nil \pc
 \nil}{\sigma} 
\derives{\tout}
E \pc F^\prime \pc \lcloc{m}{\nil \pc \nil}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent to give a final process which is very similar to the original.
More generally, subjective process movement may be encoded as

\begin{equation}
\seml in\ m\ F.E \semr \eqdef z.F \pc \procin{z}{m}.E
\end{equation}

\noindent where $F$ is the process that will move in to $m$, $E$ is
the continuation and $z$ is a new name that doesn't appear free in the
surrounding context.  The converse is pretty much the same:

\begin{equation}
\seml out\ m\ F.E \semr \eqdef z.F \pc \procout{z}{m}.E
\end{equation}

These definitions require the availability of $z$ as a new action name.
Subjective movement is safer on an ad-hoc basis where the surrounding
context is known.

Returning to the semantics, note that channels in $E$ may become
unrestricted due to the movement of the process to a different environ.
This is illustrated in the rules by $((E \pc G) \setminus \vec{b})$,
which becomes simply $G \setminus \vec{b}$ when $E$ changes position.
As a result, any names that were members of $\vec{b}$ and thus
restricted in $E$ are no longer in this situation following the movement
of the process.  Actions are scoped to individual environs, and the
names are unique, so $E$ can neither see the name in the old environ,
nor maintain its own copy.

\subsection{Type System}
\label{typesys}

This final section focuses on the specification of a simple type
system for the calculus, which fulfils two main goals:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensures the sanity of a given TNT construction, which is
  implicit in the examples above.  This is primarily achieved by
  ensuring that normal process primitives and the primitives used by
  bouncers remain distinct.  For example,
  $\tntin{n}.\bin.\nil$ should not be a valid bouncer,
  especially as $\tntin{n}$ suggests that the bouncer (and its environ)
  should move inside $n$.
\item Restrict mobility by type in addition to cardinality.  With the
  syntax and semantics alone, movement control is limited to how many
  times an environ may be entered or exited.  With the addition of a type
  system, these operations can be restricted to processes whose type
  allows the mobility transition to take place.
\end{enumerate}

Inspiration for the type system is taken for existing research on
schemes for the ambient calculus, specifically the notion of groups
presented in \cite{ambienttypes} and \cite{m3}.

Each process is a member of a group, which determines the use of the
mobility primitives.  Each group has a type\footnote{Or, more
  accurately, as groups are types themselves, it essentially has a
  type of a type or a \emph{kind}} composed of the following sets of
environ names:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathscr{R}$ -- Environs which may be \emph{resided} in
\item $\mathscr{O}$ -- Environs which may be \emph{opened}
\item $\mathscr{L}$ -- Environs which may be \emph{left}
\item $\mathscr{E}$ -- Environs which may be \emph{entered}
\end{itemize}

$\mathscr{L}$ and $\mathscr{E}$ form subsets of $\mathscr{R}$, as
clearly, if a process may enter or leave a environ, it must also be
able to reside within it.  As an example, consider the group
$(\{n\},\emptyset, \emptyset,\{n\})$.  Processes which are members of
this group may enter and reside in $n$, but, once there, they may not
leave.  They also lack the ability to destroy $n$.

Table \ref{tab:basictypes} presents the basic rules and the rudimentary
types used for the basic elements of the syntax, such as $\nil$.  As is
standard in the literature, the types are defined with respect to a type
environment, $\Gamma$.  On this note, the rule $Env$ simply states that
if $\xi$ of type $T$ is a member of $\Gamma$, then a typing derivation
$\vdash \xi : T$ may be made in the context of $\Gamma$.  This forms the
basis of all later rules.

     {\Gamma \vdash a : Name, E : g : Group}
     {\Gamma \vdash E \setminus a : g}
     {}
 \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \shrule
\end{table}

The remaining rules in Table \ref {tab:basictypes} provide types for the
processes.  Via $Nil$ and $Stop$, both $\nil$ and $\Delta$ are given a
type of $g$, where $g$ is a group.  The only precondition for these
derivations is that $g$ is typeable as a $Group$ in the environment,
$Gamma$.  Likewise, $\Omega$ can be typed as a $Bouncer$, thus
distinguishing it from normal processes, such as $\nil$.

The other rules are also relatively straightforward.  $Stall$ simply
says that $\Delta_{\sigma}$ may be typed as a process of group $g$ if
$\sigma$ is a clock.  $Act$ states that $\alpha.E$ is a process in $g$
if $\alpha$ is typeable as an action ($Act$, which includes names,
co-names and $\tau$) and $E$ is also typeable as a process in the same
group.  In the same vein, $Rec$ and $Res$ type recursive and restricted
processes respectively, if the constituent process, $E$, is already
typeable as a process.  In the case of $Res$, $a$ must be a name
($Name$) if the process is to be successfully typed.

In Table \ref{tab:operatortypes}, types are given to the composition of
processes using the binary operators for summation, parallel composition
and timeout.  All four are mostly identical, providing a type for the
process resulting from the combination of the operator with two other
processes, $E$ and $F$.  Each process is given a type, which must
be equivalent groups within the union of the two environments, $\Gamma$
and $\Gamma^\prime$.

     {\Gamma \cup \Gamma^\prime \vdash B + B^\prime : Bouncer}
     {}
 \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \shrule
\end{table}

The only other issue worthy of note with respect to these rules is that
$FTO$ and $STO$ also require that $\sigma$ is typeable as a clock,
another restriction which simply makes explicit a number of issues
implied in the syntax.  Table \ref{tab:operatortypes} also includes
a summation rule for bouncers, which simply requires that each bouncer
is typeable as a $Bouncer$ under the union of the two type environments,
$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\prime$.

The types in Tables \ref{tab:basictypes} and \ref{tab:operatortypes}
provide the basis for the mobility types presented in Table
\ref{tab:mobilitytypes}, which form the focus of this type system.
$g(\mathscr{R})$, $g(\mathscr{O})$, $g(\mathscr{L})$ and
$g(\mathscr{E})$ represent the sets of environ names that form the
group, $g$.

$Environ$ is a fundamental rule, which links environs, bouncers, clocks
and processes.  If $m$ is a environ name ($Environ$), $P$ is a process
of type $g$ (where $g$ is a $Group$) and $B$ is a $Bouncer$, then the
process $P$ may be typed as $g$ while encapsulated within the environ
$m$, with its bouncer $B$.  The later rules rely on this to provide a
type for the existing environ.

$EnvIn$, $EnvOut$ and $Open$ are fairly similar, all pertaining to
whether a particular environ movement is typeable, based on the groups
of the processes within them.  $EnvIn$ states that if $m$ is a environ
name, and $P$ is a process typed with the group, $g$, then $P$ may be
prefixed with the $\tntin{m}$ mobility primitive if m is an element of
the set $g(\mathscr{E})$, where $g(\mathscr{E})$ is the set of environ
names which members of group $g$ may enter.

The $EnvOut$ rules differs from $EnvIn$ in that it provides a context
for the movement which will occur when $\tntout{m}$ is performed.  This
is necessary because, not only must the resulting process,
$\tntout{m}.P$, be able to leave $m$, but it must also be able to enter
the environ above, $n$.  This is unnecessary in $EnvIn$ as $P$ does not
leave the environ above.  These restrictions are enforced by requiring
that the group of $P$, $g$, has $m$ as an element of $g(\mathscr{L})$ (so
$P$ can leave $m$) and $n$ as an element of $g(\mathscr{E})$ (so $P$ can
enter $n$).

$Open$ has similar requirements.  $P$ is the process that performs the
mobility primitive, $\tntopen{m}$, which requires its group, $g$, to
contain $m$ in the set of environ names which may be opened.  However,
the destruction of $m$ also has an effect on processes located in $m$,
represented as $Q$.  As a result, $Q$ must have an appropriate group,
$h$, such that $Q$ can reside in the parent environ, $n$, after $m$ is
removed.  $ProcIn$ and $ProcOut$ are nearly identical to $EnvIn$ and
$EnvOut$; the main difference is that they must provide additional
contextual information (as well as requiring the typeability of the
name, $a$) in order to handle the involvement of two processes rather
than simply one.

The final table, \ref{tab:bouncertypes}, adds some simple rules to
complete the typing of the bouncers.  $BRec$ allows recursive bouncers
to be defined, while $BIn$, $BOut$ and $BOpen$ allow an existing
bouncer, $B$, to be prefixed with one of the three bouncer primitives
($\bin$, $\bout$ and $\bopen$).

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{futurework}

This paper presented a novel combination of process synchronisation and
mobility with the concept of discrete time.  In the process, we
introduced the concept of synchronization-based objective process
mobility and specific security processes, which are believed to be new
to the field of process algebra.  The resulting process calculus is
expected to provide a sufficient framework to tackle the concepts
mentioned in the introduction.

With regard to future work, we have yet to prove that the observational
equivalence theory defined for CaSE remains a congruence when extended
with the three new mobility transitions and syntactic additions of TNT.  We
also intend to begin development on a tool, DynamiTE, which will allow
both simulation of TNT processes and a mapping of these onto Java
objects and its underlying concurrency model.  In the long term, we
intend to consider further extensions to the calculus.  One possibility
is the generalisation of the notion of bouncers to a general property
attachment mechanism for environs, so that environs can also have, for
example, associated stochastic measures.  In the type system, an
inferencing algorithm would be beneficial to avoid the current reliance
on a pre-populated type environment.
