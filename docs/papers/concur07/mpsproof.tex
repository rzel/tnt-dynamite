\section{Equivalence Theory}
\label{sec:equivalence-theory}

What does it mean for two environs $\locv{m}{P}{B}{\vec\rho}$ and
$\locv{n}{Q}{C}{\vec\sigma}$ to be equivalent? We will adopt the standard Morris-style  \cite{Mor68} (or \emph{may-testing} \cite{DNH84}) approach used to characterise
both equivalence of Mobile Ambients \cite{GC99} and barbed congruence in the
$\pi$-calculus \cite{SW01}. Having defined equivalence, we can prove various
safety properties. In particular, we show that $P \Eq Q$ implies that $P$ and
$Q$ have the same type relative to our type system.

\subsection{Immediate Observability}
\label{sec:immediate-observability}

We first define three predicates $\expr \ExhibitsA \alpha$, $\expr \ExhibitsC
\sigma$ and $\expr \ExhibitsE n$, describing the immediate observability of
actions and clocks, and the immediate top-level placement of environs,
respectively. For each predicate $\Exhibits{\bullet}$ we then define a
corresponding contextual equivalence $\Eq_{\bullet}$. Finally, we define
equivalence $\Eq$ for TNT processes to be the conjunction of these three
equivalences. We use the word \emph{symbol} to mean any action, clock or environ
name.

\subsubsection{Actions.}
The notion of immediate observability of an action needs to take account of possible timeouts. For example, the action $a$ can occur immediately in both $a\pref\nil$ and $\timeout{a\pref\nil}{\sigma}{b\pref\nil}$, while the action $b$ can occur immediately in neither. We can capture the required behaviour quite simply, however, by appealing to our semantics.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits} the action $\alpha$, and write $\expr \ExhibitsA \alpha$, provided $\expr \Does{\alpha}$.
\end{definition}


\subsubsection{Clocks.} 

Clocks are used in TNT to delimit segments of behaviour. Consequently, we
consider a clock to be immediately observable if it is possible for it to be the
next clock whose ticking can be seen to occur in the expression's reduction.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits} the clock $\sigma$, and write $\expr \ExhibitsC \sigma$, provided $\expr \Does{\sigma}$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Environs} 

Following Gordon and Cardelli \cite{GC99} we say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits}
the environ $n$ whenever $n$ is the name of a `top-level' environ. However, our
definition again needs to take account of potential time-outs. For example, $n$
is exhibited in both $\loc{n}{P}{B}{\sigma}$ and
$\timeout{\loc{n}{P}{B}{\sigma}}{\sigma}{\nil}$. In addition, the presence of time-out operators means that restrictions can occur at several locations in the expression, without affecting the environ's visibility.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits} the environ $n$, and write $\expr \ExhibitsE
n$, provided $\expr$ is of one of the forms 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    $\locv{n}{\exprb}{B}{\vec{\sigma}}$;
\item
    $\timeout{ \expr' }{\rho}{\exprb}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$;
\item
    $\stimeout{ \expr' }{\rho}{\exprb}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$; or
\item
    $\expr' \hide{\vec{\sigma}}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$.
\item
    $\expr' \res{ \vec{n} }$ where $n \not\in \vec{n}$ and $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Eventual Observability}
\label{sec:eventual-observability}

A symbol $x$ is \emph{eventually observable} (we shall sometimes say it is \emph{revealed}) in an expression $\expr$ precisely when $x$ is the first \emph{relevant} action of the appropriate class.


\subsubsection{Actions.}

There is only one `invisible' action, namely $\tau$. This does not mean, however, that $\tau$ cannot be revealed. Rather, we don't care about \emph{extra} occurrences of $\tau$.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{reveals} the action $\alpha$, and write $\expr \RevealsA \alpha$, provided there is some $\expr'$ such that $\expr \DoesMany{\tau} \expr' \ExhibitsA \alpha$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Clocks.}

Clocks are used to delimit activities, so we should allow normal actions to proceed between clock ticks without prejudicing the subsequent tick's right to be considered eventually observed.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{reveals} the clock $\sigma$, and write $\expr \RevealsC \alpha$, provided there is some $\expr'$ and some $\vec{\alpha} \in \act^*$ such that $\expr \Does{\vec{\alpha}} \expr' \ExhibitsC \sigma$.
\end{definition}

Since clocks are automatically hidden by enclosure in an environ, and cannot be introduced syntactically except within time-out, the following characterisation is straightforward.

\begin{proposition}
If $\expr \RevealsC$, then $\expr$ is of one of the forms
\begin{enumerate}
\item
    $\timeout{\exprb}{\sigma}{\exprb'}$;
\item
    $\stimeout{\exprb}{\sigma}{\exprb'}$;
\item
    $\timeout{\expr'}{\sigma}{\exprb'}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsC \sigma$;
\item
    $\stimeout{\expr'}{\sigma}{\exprb'}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsC \sigma$;
\item
    $\expr' \hide{\vec{\sigma}}$ where $\sigma \not\in \vec{\sigma}$ and $\expr' \ExhibitsC n$.
\item
    $\expr' \res{ \vec{n} }$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsC \sigma$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Straightforward. \textbf{Am checking.}
\qed \end{proof}



\subsubsection{Environs.}

An environ is eventually observed provided it can be brought to top level by some sequence of mobility-based reductions.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{reveals} the environ $n$, and write $\expr \RevealsE n$, provided there is some $\expr'$ and some $\vec{\ambop} \in \{\tin, \tout, \topen\}^*$ such that $\expr \Does{\vec{\ambop}} \expr' \ExhibitsE n$.
\end{definition}



\subsection{Contextual Congruence}
\label{sec:contextual-congruence}

As usual, a \emph{context} $C$ is an expression with one or more `holes'. We write $[\,]$ for a hole, and $C[\expr]$ for the expression obtained by filling $C$'s holes with copies of $\expr$ (this may result in free names and variables in $\expr$ becoming bound).

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ range over arbitrary contexts. Two expressions are
\begin{enumerate}
\item
    \emph{action equivalent}, written $\expr \EqA \exprb$, provided they reveal the same actions in every context: $C[\expr] \RevealsA \alpha \Leftrightarrow C[\exprb] \RevealsA \alpha$;
\item
    \emph{clock equivalent}, written $\expr \EqC \exprb$, provided they reveal the same clocks in every context: $C[\expr] \RevealsC \sigma \Leftrightarrow C[\exprb] \RevealsC \sigma$;

\item
    \emph{environ equivalent}, written $\expr \EqE \exprb$, provided they reveal the same environs in every context: $C[\expr] \RevealsE n \Leftrightarrow C[\exprb] \RevealsE n$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Finally, full equivalence of TNT expressions is defined to be the conjunction of action, clock and mobility equivalence.
\begin{definition}[Expression Equivalence]
Two expressions are (contextually) \emph{equivalent}, written provided they are action-, clock- and environ-equivalent. That is,
    $\expr \Eq \exprb
     \Means
     \left( \expr \EqA \exprb \right)$
     and
     $\left( \expr \EqC \exprb \right)$
     and
     $\left( \expr \EqE \exprb \right)$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Contextual equiavlence is a congruence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Straightforward \textbf{Am checking}
\qed \end{proof}
