\section{Equivalence Theory}
\label{sec:equivalence-theory}

What does it mean for two environs $\locv{m}{P}{B}{\vec\rho}$ and $\locv{n}{Q}{C}{\vec\sigma}$ to be equivalent? Since TNT combines features that are analogous to those found in the Ambient Calculus, we will adopt the standard Morris-style approach used by Gordon and Cardelli \cite{GC} to define \emph{contextual equivalence} for Mobile Ambients.


Since TNT combines features of several earlier process calculi, we first desribe the approaches taken there.
