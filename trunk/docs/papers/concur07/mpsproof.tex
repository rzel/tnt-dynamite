\section{Equivalence Theory}
\label{sec:equivalence-theory}

What does it mean for two environs $\locv{m}{P}{B}{\vec\rho}$ and
$\locv{n}{Q}{C}{\vec\sigma}$ to be equivalent? We will adopt the standard Morris-style  \cite{Mor68} (or \emph{may-testing} \cite{DNH84}) approach used to characterise
both equivalence of Mobile Ambients \cite{GC99} and barbed congruence in the
$\pi$-calculus \cite{sangiorgi:book}. Having defined equivalence, we can prove various
safety properties. In particular, we show that $P \Eq Q$ implies that $P$ and
$Q$ have the same type relative to our type system.

\subsection{Immediate Observability}
\label{sec:immediate-observability}

We first define three predicates $\expr \ExhibitsA \alpha$, $\expr \ExhibitsC
\sigma$ and $\expr \ExhibitsE n$, describing the immediate observability of
actions and clocks, and the immediate top-level placement of environs,
respectively. For each predicate $\Exhibits{\bullet}$ we then define a
corresponding contextual equivalence $\Eq_{\bullet}$. Finally, we define
equivalence $\Eq$ for TNT processes to be the conjunction of these three
equivalences. We use the word \emph{symbol} to mean any action, clock or environ
name.

\subsubsection{Actions.}
The notion of immediate observability of an action needs to take account
of possible timeouts. For example, the action $a$ can occur immediately
in both $a\pref\nil$ and $\timeout{a\pref\nil}{\sigma}{b\pref\nil}$,
while the action $b$ can occur immediately in neither. We can capture
the required behaviour quite simply, however, by appealing to our
semantics.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits} the action $\alpha$, and write
$\expr \ExhibitsA \alpha$, provided $\expr \Does{\alpha}$.
\end{definition}


\subsubsection{Clocks.} 

We consider a clock to be immediately observable if it can tick
immediately.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits} the clock $\sigma$, and write $\expr
\ExhibitsC \sigma$, provided $\expr \Does{\sigma}$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Environs.} 

Following Gordon and Cardelli \cite{GC99} we say that $\expr$
\emph{exhibits} the environ $n$ whenever $n$ is the name of a
`top-level' environ. However, our definition again needs to take account
of potential time-outs. For example, $n$ is exhibited in both
$\loc{n}{P}{B}{\sigma}$ and
$\timeout{\loc{n}{P}{B}{\sigma}}{\sigma}{\nil}$. In addition, the
presence of time-out operators means that restrictions can occur at
several locations in the expression, without affecting the environ's
visibility.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{exhibits} the environ $n$, and write $\expr
\ExhibitsE n$, provided $\expr$ is of one of the forms
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    $\locv{n}{\exprb}{B}{\vec{\sigma}}$;
\item
    $\timeout{ \expr' }{\rho}{\exprb}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$;
\item
    $\stimeout{ \expr' }{\rho}{\exprb}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$; or
\AJH{\DELTEXT We don't have this operator...
\item
    $\expr' \hide{\vec{\sigma}}$ where $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$.}{}
\AJH{\DELTEXT Restriction is on actions not environ names...
\item
    $\expr' \res{ \vec{n} }$ where $n \not\in \vec{n}$ and $\expr' \ExhibitsE n$.}{}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Eventual Observability}
\label{sec:eventual-observability}

A symbol $x$ is \emph{eventually observable} (we shall sometimes say it
is \emph{revealed}) in an expression $\expr$ precisely when $x$ is the
first \emph{relevant} action of the appropriate class. As usual, we
write $\DoesTaus$ for the reflexive transitive closure of $\Does{\tau}$.


\subsubsection{Actions.}

There is only one unobservable action, $\tau$. This does not mean,
however, that $\tau$ cannot be revealed. Rather, we don't care about
\emph{additional} occurrences of $\tau$.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{reveals} the action $\alpha$, and write $\expr
\RevealsA \alpha$, provided there is some $\expr'$ such that $\expr
\DoesTaus \expr' \ExhibitsA \alpha$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Clocks.}

Clocks are used to delimit activities, so we should allow normal actions
to proceed between clock ticks without prejudicing the subsequent tick's
right to be considered eventually observed.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{reveals} the clock $\sigma$, and write $\expr
\RevealsC \sigma$, provided there is some $\expr'$ and some $\vec{s} \in
\left( \act \cup \{ \tin, \tout, \topen \}\right)^*$ such that $\expr
\Does{\vec{s}} \expr' \ExhibitsC \sigma$.
\end{definition}


\subsubsection{Environs.}

An environ is eventually observed provided it can be brought to top
level by some sequence of mobility-based reductions.

\begin{definition}
We say that $\expr$ \emph{reveals} the environ $n$, and write $\expr
\RevealsE n$, provided there is some $\expr'$ and some $\vec{\ambop} \in
\{\tin, \tout, \topen\}^*$ such that $\expr \Does{\vec{\ambop}} \expr'
\ExhibitsE n$.
\end{definition}



\subsection{Contextual Congruence}
\label{sec:contextual-congruence}

As usual, a \emph{context} $C$ is an expression with one or more
`holes'. We write $[\,]$ for a hole, and $C[\expr]$ for the expression
obtained by filling $C$'s holes with copies of $\expr$ (this may result
in free names and variables in $\expr$ becoming bound).

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ range over arbitrary contexts. Two expressions are
\begin{enumerate}
\item
    \emph{action equivalent}, written $\expr \EqA \exprb$, provided they
     reveal the same actions in every context: $C[\expr] \RevealsA
     \alpha \Leftrightarrow C[\exprb] \RevealsA \alpha$;
\item
    \emph{clock equivalent}, written $\expr \EqC \exprb$, provided they
     reveal the same clocks in every context: $C[\expr] \RevealsC \sigma
     \Leftrightarrow C[\exprb] \RevealsC \sigma$;

\item
    \emph{environ equivalent}, written $\expr \EqE \exprb$, provided
     they reveal the same environs in every context: $C[\expr] \RevealsE
     n \Leftrightarrow C[\exprb] \RevealsE n$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Finally, full equivalence of TNT expressions is defined to be the
conjunction of action, clock and mobility equivalence.
\begin{definition}[Expression Equivalence]
Two expressions $\expr$ and $\exprb$ are (contextually)
\emph{equivalent}, written $\expr \Eq \exprb$, provided they are
action-, clock- and environ-equivalent. That is,
\[
    \expr \Eq \exprb
    \Means
    \left( \expr \EqA \exprb \right)
    \land
    \left( \expr \EqC \exprb \right)
    \land 
    \left( \expr \EqE \exprb \right)
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:context-substitution} 
Suppose $\expr \Eq \exprb$. Given any context $C[]$, we have $C[\expr]
\Eq C[\exprb]$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Given any context $C'[]$, let $C'[C[]]$ be the result of filling the
holes in $C'$ with copies of $C$. Then $C'[C[]]$ is itself a context,
whence $C'[C[\expr]]$ and $C'[C[\exprb]]$ reveal the same actions,
clocks and environs. Since $C'[]$ was arbitrary, we have $C[\expr] \Eq
C[\exprb]$, as claimed.  \qed \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Contextual equivalence is a congruence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Follows immediately from proposition \ref{prop:context-substitution}.
\qed \end{proof}


Proving that two expressions are not congruent is generally easy. For
example, $a\pref\nil \NotEq b\pref\nil$ because $a\pref\nil$ reveals $a$
but $b\pref\nil$ doesn't. Proving that two expressions are congruent is
more difficult. We illustrate the technique we use by proving the simple
congruence $\left(a\pref\expr \res{a}\right) \Eq \nil$, which is useful
for tidying up expression reductions. Our proof technique relies on the
nature of reductions in contextual expressions.

Suppose the context $C[\,]$ contains $n$ holes; we will write
$C[\,]_1\dots[\,]_n$. Then $C[\expr]$ means
$C[\expr]_1\dots[\expr]_n$. If $\expr \Does{x}$, then (depending on the
nature of $C$), it is possible that $C[\expr] \Does{x}
C[\expr]_1\dots[\expr']_j\dots[\expr]_n$ for some $j$. We say that such
a transition is \emph{local} to $\expr$ in $C$. On the other hand, there
are some transitions that $C[\expr]$ can perform, regardless of
$\expr$. We call these transitions \emph{global} in $C$. For example,
the transition
\[
\out{a}.[\,] \mid a \pref b \pref [\,] \quad\Does{\tau}\quad [\,] \mid b
\pref [\,] \] is global. All other transition in $C[\expr]$ are
\emph{distributed}.

Distributed transitions are those that involve reduction of subcontexts
of the form $C'|[\,]$, $C' + [\,]$ and
$\locv{n}{[\,]}{B}{\vec{\sigma}}$. For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item
    $\nil + a\pref\nil \Does{\sigma}$ but $\nil + \Delta_\sigma
     \not\Does{\sigma}$, so clock transitions are distributed in the
     context $\nil + [\,]$.
\item
    $a\pref\nil \mid \out{a}\pref\nil \Does{\tau}$ but $a\pref\nil \mid
     \nil \not\Does{\tau}$, so $\Does{\tau}$ is distributed in the
     context \AJH{$a\pref\nil + [\,]$}{$a\pref\nil \mid [\,]$}.
\item
    $\locv{m}{ \locv{n}{\tntout{m}\pref\nil}{}{} }{}{} \Does{\tout}$ but
    $\locv{m}{ \nil }{}{} \not\Does{\tout}$, so $\Does{\tout}$ is
     distributed in the context $\locv{m}{ [\,] }{}{}$.
\end{itemize}
The following results are immediate.

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $\expr \not\Does{x}$ where $x$ is either $a$ or $\sigma$. If
$C[\expr] \Does{x}$ then the $\Does{x}$ transition is global.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The only distributed transitions are $\Does{\sigma}$, $\Does{\tau}$,
$\Does{\tin}$, $\Does{\tout}$ and $\Does{\topen}$.
\end{proposition}

We can now prove the congruence claimed above. To see that
$\left(a\pref\expr \res{a}\right) \Eq \nil$, we observe that
$\left(a\pref\expr \res{a}\right)$ cannot reveal any
actions. Consequently, any visible action in $C[a\pref\expr \res{a}]$
must be global, and hence revealed by $C[\nil]$. Moreover, the lack of
visible actions means that $\Does{\tau}$ cannot be generated by
interaction between $a\pref\expr \res{a}$ and a neighbouring
subexpression. Therefore, $\left(a\pref\expr \res{a}\right) \EqA
\nil$. Since neither expression cites environs or mobility transitions,
they cannot contribute to distributed mobility transitions in any
context $C$, whence $\left(a\pref\expr \res{a}\right) \EqE
\nil$. Finally, we note that both expressions reveal all clocks
$\sigma$, so that $\left(a\pref\expr \res{a}\right) \EqC \nil$, and we
are done.


\subsection{Coherence of the Definitions}
Although we have defined contextual congruence without reference to the
type system, it is important to show that they respect one another. The
following theorem illustrates the coherence of our definitions.

\begin{theorem}
If $\expr \Eq \exprb$ and $\Theorem \expr \OfType g$, then $\Theorem
\exprb \OfType g$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{Hmmmm.} 
\qed \end{proof}
