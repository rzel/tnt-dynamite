DynamiTE README - Last updated: Feb 18, 2009

DynamiTE is a programming framework written in the Java programming
language.  It allows the individual constructs of a process calculus
to be used as programmatic elements in designing programs.  For
example, two processes can be run in parallel simply by composing them
using the class representing the Parallel (|) operator.  This allows
the specification of system interactions to be shifted directly from
the theoretical domain into an implementation backed by a formal
methodology, helping in turn to improve industrial adoption of
concurrent techniques.  

This is a development snapshot release only and is not for general
purpose use.

See the file INSTALL for details on installing DynamiTE.
See the file NEWS for details on what is included in this release.
See the file TODO for the latest to do list.
