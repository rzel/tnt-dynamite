DynamiTE is a programming framework written in the Java programming
language.  It allows the individual constructs of a process calculus
to be used as programmatic elements in designing programs.  For
example, two processes can be run in parallel simply by composing them
using the class representing the Parallel (|) operator.  This allows
the specification of system interactions to be shifted directly from
the theoretical domain into an implementation backed by a formal
methodology, helping in turn to improve industrial adoption of
concurrent techniques.  

This is a development snapshot release only and is not for general
purpose use.
